> :closed_book: still a work in progress :exclamation:

These are application templates for use with the Corona SDK. They show one type of architecture which is simple to understand and scalable.

**Large**

The large template has already been used on numerous projects with multiple developers and easily handled 45k+ LOC.

This template is recommended when:
* the app is very complex (eg, multiple sections, complex business rules, etc)
* there are multiple developers
* other people (contractors) are building parts of the app
* you want to leave nothing to chance
